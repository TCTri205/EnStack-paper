TIMING ANALYSIS - CRITICAL FINDING
===================================

DATA FROM LOG:
--------------
Progress: 1047/1270
Time: 03:50 = 230 seconds
Speed: 4.69s/it
Resume from: step 1000

CALCULATION:
------------
1047 iterations done in 230 seconds
230s / 1047 = 0.22s per iteration??? WAIT!

NO! TQDM is WRONG!

With CODE OLD (enumerate + initial=resume_step):
  - enumerate(dataloader) counts from 0
  - TQDM initial=1000 means counter STARTS at 1000
  - When at iteration 47, TQDM shows: 1000+47 = 1047

ACTUAL PROCESSING:
------------------
Iterations processed: 1047 (real enumerate step)
Batches skipped: 1000 (with continue statement)  
Batches trained: 47 (actual training)

TIME BREAKDOWN:
---------------
Total time: 230 seconds (3:50)
Time per iteration: 230 / 1047 = 0.22s/it

BUT THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE! 
If training is 0.47s/batch, how can skip be 0.22s/batch?

ANSWER: We're STILL SKIPPING!
  - 1047 batches loaded and skipped
  - 0 batches trained yet
  - Each load+skip takes: 230/1047 = 0.22s

WAIT - That's FASTER than training???

Let me recalculate with CORRECT understanding:

TQDM initial=1000 means:
  - Progress bar STARTS counting from 1000
  - When enumerate returns step=47, TQDM displays 1000+47=1047
  - So we've only processed 47 iterations!
  - All 47 were SKIPPED (step < 1000 check)

Time: 230s for 47 iterations = 4.9s/it
→ Matches the 4.69s/it from log!

CONCLUSION:
-----------
✅ We are STILL SKIPPING batches (loading them first)
✅ Each skip takes ~4.9s (load from Drive + tokenize + skip)
✅ Haven't started actual training yet
✅ Will need another 953 iterations × 4.9s = 78 minutes to skip remaining

THE REAL ISSUE:
---------------
Code is using:
  initial=resume_step in TQDM

This makes the COUNTER start at 1000, but enumerate STILL starts at 0!

So when log shows "1047/1270":
  - It's iteration #47 from enumerate (0-indexed)
  - TQDM counter = 1000 + 47 = 1047
  - We've only done 47 iterations
  - All were skipped (step < 1000)
  - Haven't trained anything yet!

FIX VERIFICATION:
-----------------
After applying itertools.islice fix:
  - Should show: X/270 (not X/1270)  
  - Should skip instantly
  - Should train at 0.47s/batch
